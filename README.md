####Approach / How it works

As the app is aimed for females, ony female travellers are allowed to sign up. Users are then able to create a Profile, listing their informations, such as where they currently live and would like to visit. They also have the option of uploading images, capturing their trips.

With the use of the Google maps API, The "locations" page displays out all the cities which users of the wanderfule have visited. If a city has not been 'visited' by any of the wanderful memebers, the user is able to 'create' the city and storing it into the wanderful database.

On each city show page, users can upload images that are either related to the city, or of themselves travelling to the city. Users can also communicate with eachother through the comments and share their experiences.

#### Problems & Challenges

The biggest I challenged I faced was my poor time management. I underestimated how long it would take me to style the pages. I spent a lot of time trying to perfect the functionality which made me neglect the styling.

Part of this problem was my lack of planning.

#### Things that I would do differently or better

The most important thing to is plan the process more detailed using tools such as trello. Using cards to decide each day what my focus will be on will make the workload less overwhelming and more organised. That way I also know how long to spend on each problem before moving on.

In terms of functionality I also wanted to add safety feature on the app, as that is the most important issue for solo female travellers, I was thinking that it would be great to match travellers up who are looking to visit the same city together.
